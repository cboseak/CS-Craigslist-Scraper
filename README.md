# CS-Craigslist-Scraper
A tool that navigates craigslist and pulls data from listings.

# To Do:
* Move non ui operations to use other threads so gui remains responsive 
* Impliment a modularize system for the scraping logic. Scraping is currently recursive within the document loaded event handler and somewhat spaghetti-ish
* move business logic to other class.
* make a gui, currently bare minimum needed to get the proof of concept working.

feel free to send a pull request if anyone wants to contribute.
